# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Fork/clone the repository.

Open your code editor and open the downloaded code in your code editor.

Open the terminal and run the command "npm install"

Now create the .env file in src directory and Get access key from your desired API provider. I prefered 'UNSPLASH' for it.

VITE_UNSPLASH_ACCESS='Add your access here'.

Add the above variable in your .env file.

Don't forget to add the end points in imageApi.js file if you want to use a different end point.

Now you can start the application running by the command "npm run dev".

You can see your application running on localhost:5173.
